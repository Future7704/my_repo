## 1. 
Solve the following system of equations using the `solve()` function:
$$
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
9 & 4 & 12 & 2 \\
5 & 0 & 7 & 9 \\
2 & 6 & 8 & 0 \\
9 & 2 & 9 & 11
\end{array}\right) \times\left(\begin{array}{l}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
7 \\
18 \\
1 \\
0
\end{array}\right)
$$
```{r}

```


## 2. 
Execute the following lines which create two vectors of random integers which are chosen with replacement from the integers $0, 1, \dots , 999$. Both vectors have length 250. 

```{r}
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
```

(a) Create the vector $(y_2 - x_1, \cdots, y_n - x_{n-1}).$
```{r}

```


(b) Pick out the values in yVec which are $> 600$.

```{r}

```


(c) What are the index positions in yVec of the values which are $> 600$? 

```{r}

```


(d) Sort the numbers in the vector xVec in the order of increasing values in yVec. 

```{r}

```


(e) Pick out the elements in yVec at index positions $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, \cdots$

```{r}

```

## 3.
For this problem we'll use the (built-in) dataset state.x77.
```{r}
data(state)
state.x77 <- as_tibble(state.x77, rownames  = 'State')
```

a. Select all the states having an income less than 4300, and calculate the average income of these states.
```{r}

```

b.	Sort the data by income and select the state with the highest income.
```{r}

```

c.	Add a variable to the data frame which categorizes the size of population: $<= 4500$ is `S`, $ > 4500 $ is `L`.
```{r, include=FALSE}

```

d.	Find out the average income and illiteracy of the two groups of states, distinguishing by whether the states are small or large.
```{r, include=FALSE}

```

## 4. 
a. Write a function to simulate `n` observations of $(X_1, X_2)$ which follow the uniform distribution over the square $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$.
```{r}

```

b. Write a function to calculate the proportion of the observations that the distance between $(X_1, X_2)$ and the nearest edge is less than 0.25, and the proportion of them with the distance to the nearest vertex less than 0.25.
```{r}

```

## 5.

To estimate $\pi$ with a Monte Carlo simulation, we draw the unit circle inside the unit square, the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square will be $\pi / 4$. Then shot $K$ arrows at the square, roughly $K * \pi / 4$ should have fallen inside the circle. So if now you shoot $N$ arrows at the square, and $M$ fall inside the circle, you have the following relationship $M = N * \pi / 4$. You can thus compute $\pi$ like so: $\pi = 4 * M / N$. The more arrows $N$ you throw at the square, the better approximation of $\pi$ you'll have.

```{r}
n <- 10000

set.seed(1)
points <- tibble("x" = runif(n), "y" = runif(n))
```

Now, to know if a point is inside the unit circle, we need to check whether $x^2 + y^2 < 1$. Let's add a new column to the points tibble, called `inside` equal to `1` if the point is inside the unit circle and `0` if not:

```{r}
points <- points |> 
    mutate(inside = map2_dbl(.x = x, .y = y, ~ifelse(.x**2 + .y**2 < 1, 1, 0))) |> 
    rowid_to_column("N")
```

a. Compute the estimation of $\pi$ at each row, by computing the cumulative sum of the 1's in the `inside` column and dividing that by the current value of `N` column:

```{r}

```

b. Plot the estimates of $\pi$ against `N`.

```{r}

```

## 6. 
Mortality rates per 100,000 from male suicides for a number of age groups and a number of countries are given in the following data frame. 
```{r}
suicrates <- tibble(Country = c('Canada', 'Israel', 'Japan', 'Austria', 'France', 'Germany',
'Hungary', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Poland', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'Switzerland', 'UK', 'USA'), 
Age25.34 = c(22,  9, 22, 29, 16, 28, 48,  7,  8, 26,  4, 28, 22, 10, 20), 
Age35.44 = c(27, 19, 19, 40, 25, 35, 65,  8, 11, 29,  7, 41, 34, 13, 22), 
Age45.54 = c(31, 10, 21, 52, 36, 41, 84, 11, 18, 36, 10, 46, 41, 15, 28), 
Age55.64 = c(34, 14, 31, 53, 47, 49, 81, 18, 20, 32, 16, 51, 50, 17, 33), 
Age65.74 = c(24, 27, 49, 69, 56, 52, 107, 27, 28, 28, 22, 35, 51, 22, 37))
```

a. Transform `suicrates` into *long* form.
```{r}

```

b. Construct side-by-side box plots for the data from different age groups, and comment on what the graphic tells us about the data. 
```{r}

```

## 7. 
Load the `LaborSupply` dataset from the `{Ecdat}` package and answer the following questions:

```{r}
#data(LaborSupply)
LaborSupply <- read_csv("LaborSupply.csv")
# create hour and wage variables
labor <- LaborSupply |> 
  mutate(hour = exp(lnhr), wage = exp(lnwg), .before = kids) |> 
  dplyr::select(-lnhr, -lnwg)
```

a. Compute the average annual hours worked and their standard deviations by year.

```{r}

```

b. What age group worked the most hours in the year 1982?

```{r}

```

c. Create a variable, `n_years` that equals the number of years an individual stays in the panel. Is the panel balanced?

```{r}

```

d. Which are the individuals that do not have any kids during the whole period? Create a variable, `no_kids`, that flags these individuals (1 = no kids, 0 = kids)

```{r}

```

e. Using the `no_kids` variable from before compute the average wage, standard deviation and number of observations in each group for the year 1980 (no kids group vs kids group).

```{r}

```
